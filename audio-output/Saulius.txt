0:00:00 :  okay start we've done the part right we've done the part already so Nancy
0:00:14.840000 :  you have and Kelvin Kelvin right out okay so
0:00:26.760000 :  yeah I'm professor Hinn Kee and assistant professor in the department here
0:00:32.160000 :  for three years now working primarily in contemporary European philosophy and
0:00:42.240000 :  I'm Saulus Saulus Genitras so I'm professor here I've been here for 12 years as well as
0:00:47.880000 :  now I serve in the capacity as a department chair also working in mainly
0:00:54.240000 :  in European philosophy but as you know offering also a variety of other courses
0:00:58.720000 :  as also professor Keats. Before we get into the gender issues part we actually
0:01:07.360000 :  can't want to know more about the position being a department head. Can you tell us more about
0:01:14.800000 :  what does a department head do exactly? Close to a normal teaching staff. Right so there are a number of
0:01:27.720000 :  administrative responsibilities that the department chair has but in general I
0:01:34.200000 :  would say that you know there are different departments worldwide out of all departments
0:01:40.080000 :  I would say our department is one of the most democratic ones that I have seen. What do I mean by that?
0:01:45.600000 :  By this I mean that virtually all of the decisions that are reached have to pass through certain
0:01:51.800000 :  committees so in some departments a department chair is the one who you know reaches a decision
0:01:57.200000 :  and and one moves on from there that's certainly not the case at COHK so there are a number of you
0:02:03.680000 :  know day-to-day matters to attend there are also matters relating to strategic planning and then
0:02:12.200000 :  often the initiative comes from the department chair. The department chair usually serves on
0:02:19.200000 :  more committees than others so committee work you know eats up a lot of time. The department chair
0:02:25.480000 :  is the one who also mediates between the department and the faculty. So we as a department of philosophy
0:02:35.280000 :  are within the faculty of art and then you know we need to comply with certain policies within the
0:02:44.640000 :  faculty but we also need to let the department the department's voice be heard. So these are
0:02:53.880000 :  briefly the functions of the department chair. I've heard you've become the department chair since last year right?
0:03:03.080000 :  That's right. How does the process go? What process has to be gone through in order for you to become a department chair?
0:03:12.960000 :  Right so usually there are nominations. Nominations are followed by reflections and then one either
0:03:22.560000 :  accepts or one does not. That's basically how it goes. So candidates are nominated, the department
0:03:32.640000 :  reaches a decision which of the nominees should be you know supported and then of course the
0:03:42.120000 :  candidate still has the freedom to say yes or no. The nominations come from within the department
0:03:49.680000 :  and then the decision is made by the executive committee. That's right. So an executive committee
0:03:55.240000 :  within the department looks at all the nominations and votes. So what are the executive committee?
0:04:03.200000 :  The executive committee is made up of ten department members. Now we have ten I believe. Ten department members.
0:04:11.120000 :  Generally the more senior members but there are a few different criteria for who's on the committee.
0:04:23.360000 :  The end of the makeup changes every year. In other words, can staff still have the right to be vetoed?
0:04:31.080000 :  Absolutely. We also have the department board. The idea is to relieve all colleagues of various
0:04:41.080000 :  responsibilities that eat up very much time. So those colleagues who don't serve on the executive
0:04:46.920000 :  committee they do in effect have much more time for their own work, for teaching, for research,
0:04:52.160000 :  for their own personal matters. So the idea is not to have the whole department so that it functions
0:04:59 :  better. That's an overall structure within the university. Can you describe the general life of a scholar in the law department?
0:05:19.760000 :  What does it do? You mentioned teaching and research and some administration.
0:05:24.680000 :  That's right. So usually I remember when I got my first position before I moved to Hong Kong in the
0:05:33.440000 :  United States the department chair was the dean then told me that you know the real challenge of
0:05:40.440000 :  being a faculty member is that one needs to sit on a chair with three legs and one needs to balance
0:05:45.840000 :  so as not to fall. Those three legs are teaching, research and service. So if you go too much on one side you fall.
0:05:55.680000 :  If you go too much on the other side you fall. So these are indeed the three fundamental responsibilities.
0:06:01.640000 :  CUHK is a research university so research matters very much. At the same time especially the department
0:06:12.200000 :  but not only the department. Historically the department very much values the quality of teaching.
0:06:19.400000 :  So often, not so rarely, let me put it this way, our colleagues win teaching awards. So in fact today we were at a ceremony
0:06:31.360000 :  where Professor Key received a teaching award in general education. So this is something the department takes very seriously.
0:06:38.240000 :  And then you know for the most part I would say fewer colleagues want to be engaged in service because of the nature of the work.
0:06:47.720000 :  But then for the most part indeed as Professor Key mentioned there is this general understanding that the more the longer the faculty members have been in the department
0:07:01.600000 :  the more service obligations they should take on because they know the department better. They understand the details better.
0:07:10.160000 :  And also it is part of our responsibility to relieve junior faculty members of many of these responsibilities so that they can focus more on teaching and research.
0:07:23.160000 :  Maybe also worth mentioning that service is not just within the department but one also has service responsibilities to faculty, university and college.
0:07:33.160000 :  That's right. Thank you for this addition indeed. And also on Canada there is also external service. So also service to the community.
0:07:41.160000 :  It can be service to publishing houses, it can be service to journals, it can be service say serving on certain examination committees at other universities.
0:07:55.160000 :  So you know different kinds of service. So I hope that clarifies the matter somewhat.
0:08:04.160000 :  That's right. You only see us in the classroom maybe three or six hours a week. So it's natural that you're curious what do these guys do the rest of the time.
0:08:13.160000 :  We try to find some more information on the internet but there's not much. There's not much information for us.
0:08:21.160000 :  I guess we can move into the meat of our conversation.
0:08:28.160000 :  So we've noticed that we've got some information from the department when we know that there are generally more male students than females in the department.
0:08:46.160000 :  For undergraduate students I remember the statistics about 73. So 70% of undergraduate students are male and 30% are female.
0:09:02.160000 :  The statistics hover around that number but we don't quite actually know how's the situation for postgraduate students. I wonder if you know anything about that.
0:09:13.160000 :  Yeah. So indeed there are more male students especially at the undergraduate level in the philosophy department.
0:09:26.160000 :  In this regard our department is by no means unique. We have very supportive staff in the department and they provided me with some details about this.
0:09:41.160000 :  So I double checked the details and the details that I received were that worldwide a discipline such as philosophy appeals more to male students.
0:09:51.160000 :  And on average in Western universities and I guess that means in North America as well as in Europe there are from 30 to 35% of female students enrolled in the undergraduate programs.
0:10:11.160000 :  So the majority indeed worldwide is male. Let me see if I wrote this down. I did not. Basically when I found out the numbers at UH State were exactly there.
0:10:27.160000 :  I double checked. We are about 35%. It's only more than 30. I think 30 from 72 I can double check if you're interested. So that's sort of as far as the numbers are concerned.
0:10:41.160000 :  Generally I did not check this but generally there are more female students I would guess at the post-graduate level. But I'm not sure because I did not check. But that's my general impression.
0:10:58.160000 :  Still I would say there are more male students than female students. So this is briefly about the composition of philosophy. So indeed for historical reasons some of them you mentioned in the draft.
0:11:17.160000 :  So I think that philosophy appeals more to male students than to female students. Of course this is very much changing. And each year there are more and more female students in the departments of philosophy.
0:11:32.160000 :  So that's also quite clear. Not only changing I was really shocked. It's honestly not an overstatement by some of the comments that people were referring to that I presume male students were making about female students.
0:11:52.160000 :  Such as it was in the draft, the place of women is in the kitchen and similar things. So not only this is just really unbelievable but it's also to tell the truth completely stupid.
0:12:06.160000 :  And it's completely stupid. Why? Because it's women nowadays that have much better chances to progress further in philosophy than men. Why do I say that? Because of this recognition that departments of philosophy worldwide were privileging male students over female students.
0:12:23.160000 :  So not only is this comment imbecilic but it's also idiotic. Maybe you have something to add.
0:12:35.160000 :  I wanted to ask just by way of clarification because we saw that in the draft there were a couple of remarks and direct quotes. But we weren't sure are those things that you're directly attributing to students in the department? Or are they examples of the kind of things that one has heard? And of course we know it's just a draft so we're not sure that is.
0:12:56.160000 :  Those quotes were, we translated those quotes from our interviews and our interviews overheard them in different situations. Maybe in some gatherings or perhaps in those orientation camps etc.
0:13:15.160000 :  Even in orientation camps? I believe so. But also mostly in orientation camps and in gatherings. You can correct me if I'm wrong.
0:13:28.160000 :  I also want some further clarification on this because was this something that was said on one occasion or was it something that was said repeatedly? The comments that we hear. Do you know?
0:13:44.160000 :  What were the comments like? Women's places in the kitchen, women's talking is uninteresting. These were the comments in quotation marks.
0:13:55.160000 :  Yeah. Well our interviews overheard those conversations I guess only once or twice. But I think one thing that should be noted is that the general atmosphere within those gatherings or those groups, they do not, I can actually recount the experience.
0:14:24.160000 :  Our interviewers went to some, I remember it was a lunch gathering or some sort of dinner gathering and he overheard the conversation about women's talking is uninteresting or they belong in the kitchen.
0:14:38.160000 :  And he felt that it's wrong to say that but because others in the room does not appear to be shocked by those comments so he didn't voice out at that moment.
0:14:56.160000 :  And I remember there was also a female student at the gathering also and she was the one who spoke out against the student. So that's the entire experience they had.
0:15:12.160000 :  Okay, thanks for the clarification. In general, because this is something I hear for the first time, if we could hear about that, students, if they could either, if it happens especially in class or something of the kind, please inform the teacher.
0:15:29.160000 :  And if not the teacher, please come to the general office. Some said we don't feel comfortable because the teacher is a male. Come to the general office. Come to see me. Because this is something, definitely something that should not be happening.
0:15:48.160000 :  There should be zero tolerance for this. There's no question about that.
0:15:54.160000 :  That's absolutely right. The other part of that that's, I think part of what makes it so upsetting for me to hear that and so frustrating to hear about something like that is that this is just an area of the culture in and around the department that it's very hard for us to get any kind of traction on.
0:16:12.160000 :  Because of course we're not invited to those opportunities and don't speak the local language. So when you describe a kind of boys locker room culture and mentality among students in the department, I'm asking myself, what can I do to change and to shape that?
0:16:33.160000 :  And that's really an open and ongoing question for me to ask. How will we create a change in that level of the culture? And in that you guys are our partners, right? You need to work together and figure out how we're going to make progress on issues like that.
0:16:50.160000 :  That's right. That's right. So communication between the student body and faculty is crucial when it comes to changing. Otherwise we don't even know about this, about the problems. So from the department side, I'm sure I speak for all colleagues.
0:17:09.160000 :  Everybody will be shocked by that. There are no colleagues that will say, no, you know what, it's okay. Definitely there are none who would say that.
0:17:19.160000 :  Yeah. But I just wanted to clarify more. I still do believe it's just several isolated cases. I would not believe that it is a common thing for students to say such sexist remarks. So yeah, I would not say it is the general situation is the norm.
0:17:47.160000 :  But I think it worth some notice. Right. So again, that's right. These things should not be tolerated.
0:17:59.160000 :  Some of our interviewees has, a number of our interviewees are pretty much ex-philosophy student and many of them are females. And one reason they have transferred into another program is that because they felt that they're not welcome in the department.
0:18:23.160000 :  Not welcomed, meaning that when they participate in classes, they participate in tutorials and discussions, they felt that because most time it was men who were doing the talking.
0:18:38.160000 :  And I guess it is a consequence of the, because most students are being male, so statistically more men is going to talk in discussion classes. But what this cost in them was that they felt that they're not, they're not a part of the lesson.
0:18:59.160000 :  They're just kind of like, I'll try to say audience or just a passerby who just happens to got into the classroom and sat down, but they're not the target audience of the lecture or something like that.
0:19:17.160000 :  And it was in situations like this that they felt like they're not welcomed and some of them have transferred into other departments where they felt that they belong more, belong there more.
0:19:41.160000 :  One of our interviewees even said after she exchanged in Netherlands, she found that she actually liked philosophy, but what she doesn't like is the CHK philosophy department, like the atmosphere makes her feel subtle discomfort.
0:20:02.160000 :  I would like to add that, just the quote has, the quote is actually quite remarkable for me, I thought it was quite remarkable. She said, now I finally discovered that what I dislike was not philosophy, but rather is the philosophy department. I found that actually quite remarkable.
0:20:24.160000 :  That's right, that's right.
0:20:25.160000 :  What do you think of this?
0:20:27.160000 :  This is definitely a serious problem that we have students both who are thinking so and who are also transferring out. It would be also helpful to know whether the sense of discomfort arises because of the relation between students and professors or in the relationship with other students.
0:20:52.160000 :  If there was more clarity on that, that would be actually helpful when it comes to seeing out the trust problem. But this is indeed a problem and the reason for that is that unfortunately now we don't have female faculty members.
0:21:09.160000 :  And that's something I also have to say that the department is working very hard to change. So these are discussions about that taking place all of this academic year. I would say there is no other topic that we are discussing in virtually every single board meeting, but this topic is always discussed.
0:21:32.160000 :  We are discussing the matter with the higher ups at the university with the approval we need to look for female colleagues. So I very much hope that that changes. It's not just the discussions, but we have time to take concrete lies. You cannot change it overnight.
0:21:55.160000 :  Now, when I arrived here 12 years ago, already 12 years ago, 2012, the Department of Philosophy had only male colleagues. In fact, when I think of that, I was the only white woman, both among the faculty and also among the students.
0:22:15.160000 :  So we have become much more international, you know, but then we were more local, more regional. And somehow, but when it comes to the gender issue, that hasn't changed. And it's, you know, I have to also say it's not easy to change. Why? Because we got ourselves into a problem.
0:22:39.160000 :  There are most definitely very qualified female candidates all around. Statistically, the number of them that submit applications, I double checked with some jobs, 10%.
0:22:53.160000 :  So you are, you know, comparing like, you know, if you receive say 100 applications, 10 female, you know, 90, to begin with, these are the applications. The department has extended an offer to a female colleague last year.
0:23:11.160000 :  A very good offer.
0:23:17.160000 :  A very good offer.
0:23:18.160000 :  An outstanding offer.
0:23:20.160000 :  This really went out of our way.
0:23:22.160000 :  Absolutely.
0:23:23.160000 :  We met a very female colleague. So we went above and beyond our normal procedures as we're continuing to do.
0:23:29.160000 :  That's right. No, no, no, no, no. It's a very important initiative. One of the things that we are, you know, trying to do is also capitalize on female visiting professors.
0:23:40.160000 :  So you probably have seen that there are many more female visiting professors in the department than ever before.
0:23:47.160000 :  You know, we had, we had, who did we have? Giovanna Colobetti in the fall semester of last academic year. We had Jessica Wilson as a Tanzanian visiting professor.
0:23:59.160000 :  We have Sanjom Park who is with us for a full year. We have Claudia Baracci who is coming in the fall semester.
0:24:09.160000 :  So that's already quite a few. But of course what we want is not just to limit ourselves to female, but also to visiting professors, but also to look for permanent colleagues.
0:24:23.160000 :  So yeah, the problem is old, still before the time when I arrived here. I cannot identify the reasons for it.
0:24:31.160000 :  I was surprised also to see in the draft of the article that some of the students were saying that the problem was much deeper in the early 2000s.
0:24:39.160000 :  That's before the time when I arrived and I have no clue. You know, this is all news to me.
0:24:44.160000 :  And of course, certainly I cannot. For this, we would need to speak for colleagues who have been around longer or to some emeritus professors who might be able to speak about these things.
0:25:01.160000 :  Because otherwise we know, I hate it, we would just be speculating at the wrong times that we're not here.
0:25:08.160000 :  Did you say that when you first came to CHK, all scholars are male and all students are male?
0:25:20.160000 :  No, no. I said I was the only Guaido.
0:25:23.160000 :  Guaido?
0:25:24.160000 :  Foreigner.
0:25:25.160000 :  Yeah, because everybody, all colleagues and all students were either from Hong Kong or from mainland.
0:25:37.160000 :  Maybe some from Taiwan, I cannot say. But otherwise it was much more regional than it is now.
0:25:47.160000 :  But we had the composition was also all male, of the faculty, not of the students of course.
0:25:54.160000 :  And some of the best students over the years were female students.
0:25:58.160000 :  And some of them are pursuing their post-graduate degrees. I can point to a few of them overseas at very good universities.
0:26:05.160000 :  Some of them have gone through the program and they have done some remarkable people.
0:26:11.160000 :  Maybe here I can also, I don't know what kind of set of interviews you're thinking of publishing.
0:26:19.160000 :  But my general sense is that if you want to get an overall view of what students think,
0:26:28.160000 :  it would be good to talk not only to undergraduate students but also to post-graduate students, also to ME students.
0:26:37.160000 :  That's one thing that I would say. Also I noticed that in the draft, one of the persons says that,
0:26:48.160000 :  I forget how the person puts it, let me take a look.
0:26:54.160000 :  Because I'm from mainland, I'm more familiar with the general station of mainland students in the department.
0:27:01.160000 :  Oh yes, this is my hold up.
0:27:03.160000 :  Okay, yeah. And I wonder, you know. So here it would be of course to have a representative view.
0:27:09.160000 :  It would be good to talk to students from mainland, to students from local students, to students from elsewhere to get a representative view.
0:27:16.160000 :  But besides that, I also wonder, and somebody else mentioned that to me, to what degree is this either also, let's say also,
0:27:27.160000 :  a problem of the tensions between Hong Kongers and mainlanders.
0:27:32.160000 :  Some people were telling me that these tensions, you know, quite likely, this is a more significant reason,
0:27:41.160000 :  but it's for you to know. I just mentioned all these different factors,
0:27:48.160000 :  so as to get a representative view of what the students think. If that's what you want to do.
0:27:57.160000 :  And we can follow up about the numbers concerning the composition of the PG research programs and the MA programs.
0:28:05.160000 :  How many female students percentage wise?
0:28:08.160000 :  I haven't checked that out. As far as undergraduate students, I found somewhere no here.
0:28:13.160000 :  So there are all in all 81 students, 33 female.
0:28:18.160000 :  81 students, 31 female.
0:28:22.160000 :  Is that majors in the undergraduate?
0:28:24.160000 :  No, current undergraduate program gender mix.
0:28:27.160000 :  So, you know, due to percentage actually, that's right.
0:28:30.160000 :  So it's actually larger than it may, statistically, in many universities.
0:28:36.160000 :  That's yeah, that's closer to 40, which is I think the last I saw where most of the US departments are at these days.
0:28:43.160000 :  That being said, you know, of course these numbers are changing. They're not static.
0:28:48.160000 :  The picture is not static. The number of female students is increasing for sure as it has been.
0:28:54.160000 :  And besides that, you know, I think if we finally have permanent female faculty members,
0:29:07.160000 :  this nation will change in important ways.
0:29:11.160000 :  You mentioned last year you've sent an offer to a female professor, but she didn't took the job.
0:29:20.160000 :  That's right.
0:29:21.160000 :  You said it was a generous offer.
0:29:24.160000 :  Yes, very generous. Sorry, I hope I did not say inappropriate.
0:29:28.160000 :  It was a sure thing.
0:29:29.160000 :  Let me put it this way. At that rank, no other colleague either now in the history of the program was offered what she was offered.
0:29:39.160000 :  It was very generous.
0:29:41.160000 :  What did you offer her?
0:29:43.160000 :  I cannot go into that when the journalist is too sensitive to go into the details, right?
0:29:47.160000 :  But it was, yeah, it came with a number of research funds, you know, but you know, these are, you know, usually.
0:29:57.160000 :  But in the end she declined the offer?
0:29:58.160000 :  She declined.
0:29:59.160000 :  Did she ever say why?
0:30:03.160000 :  There were some discussions.
0:30:05.160000 :  The reason was that she said she wanted to be hired at a higher rank.
0:30:12.160000 :  Now, this introduces very big problems at any department.
0:30:17.160000 :  If somebody is less accomplished as some other junior colleagues, but the person is offered a higher position,
0:30:24.160000 :  you imagine what kind of situation the department at great, you know, constant tensions.
0:30:30.160000 :  Where once a work is, one thinks my work is not being valued, you know, others have priority like this, you know, even though they had priority to begin with, you know, but it's not enough.
0:30:42.160000 :  So that was really, probably, even if we said yes, the university would not approve because simply that qualifications, you know, you go by the qualifications by experience.
0:30:53.160000 :  And on that basis, people are often this frank or that frank.
0:30:58.160000 :  So, so yeah, so we really couldn't do anything.
0:31:01.160000 :  It's, it's, she was asking for something that we'd never done before for anyone else, as far as I understand, that would have been really unprecedented after we'd already made a more generous offer than we had to anyone else.
0:31:12.160000 :  And what that might reflect is just how difficult it is for us to secure a quality female colleague, because in some ways she might be in a different position on the job market than other people.
0:31:26.160000 :  In that she feels like she has that kind of leverage to demand that much.
0:31:32.160000 :  Well, my hope is that, you know, if you come back for a chat in two years, that we'll also invite some, you know, prominent female colleagues to join the discussion.
0:31:43.160000 :  We're working incredibly hard on this.
0:31:45.160000 :  We're working very, very hard on this and we're pushing, pushing, pushing from every angle.
0:31:50.160000 :  This is a priority.
0:31:53.160000 :  Has the department been trying this hard to secure a female professor in the past?
0:32:00.160000 :  I would say it's a new thing.
0:32:01.160000 :  It didn't start just this academic year because as Professor Key mentioned, you know, we were extending it off for last year.
0:32:10.160000 :  But I would say it's a more recent phenomenon.
0:32:14.160000 :  Right.
0:32:17.160000 :  Yeah, you would have to speak with colleagues who've been here longer to know the deeper history of how the department has its current makeup.
0:32:26.160000 :  Yeah.
0:32:27.160000 :  We've talked about the, we've more or less vaguely talked about the gender issues within the department.
0:32:35.160000 :  But I would like to know from you, what, how would you see, what do you think the issue is exactly?
0:32:44.160000 :  So we can see if our understanding is different.
0:32:48.160000 :  Like what the issue is.
0:32:49.160000 :  Yeah, that's why I asked your colleague to send me a draft of the article because it was not clear to know what issue we're going to address.
0:32:57.160000 :  Yeah.
0:32:58.160000 :  Yeah.
0:32:59.160000 :  So some female students have come to talk to me about the general problem.
0:33:05.160000 :  So I was aware of that a number of female students don't feel comfortable, you know, in the department.
0:33:13.160000 :  And this, as I mentioned, this awareness is something that now the department definitely shares as a whole.
0:33:20.160000 :  And we are trying to see what we can do about that.
0:33:24.160000 :  Now, one thing that I would say is that, you know, I mentioned that since I came here, there have been only male faculty members.
0:33:34.160000 :  So you might think, why were there no female colleagues?
0:33:39.160000 :  Generally, I would definitely say, because over the years I got to know my colleagues, it was not intentional.
0:33:45.160000 :  It was not as though something, someone would say, you know what, let's not hire female colleagues.
0:33:52.160000 :  You know, that was not it.
0:33:53.160000 :  Priorities were elsewhere.
0:33:56.160000 :  People were thinking of other matters, you know, when hiring faculty members.
0:34:03.160000 :  And as I mentioned, because we were an all male department, we would get very few applications.
0:34:08.160000 :  You know, so we were in this problematic situation where if you are thinking about the matters, you know, it's very hard to fix the problem.
0:34:18.160000 :  One more thing that you mentioned in passing, I believe it was you, but maybe you mentioned that, about, you know, female students feeling uncomfortable.
0:34:29.160000 :  Because the discussions are mainly dominated by male students.
0:34:33.160000 :  And teacher.
0:34:34.160000 :  And teacher.
0:34:35.160000 :  Yes.
0:34:36.160000 :  Well, that they are dominated by teacher, that's understandable, I think, right?
0:34:40.160000 :  But, you know, you can explain if you think, you know, there is not enough space, you know, for a discussion.
0:34:50.160000 :  Unless that's what you have in mind.
0:34:52.160000 :  But of course, you know, within a class, the teachers would not be doing their job if they said, okay, you go ahead and talk.
0:34:59.160000 :  Right?
0:35:00.160000 :  You know, the discussions are very important because it's active learning.
0:35:03.160000 :  So the question is, how do you, how do you, you know, put everything together?
0:35:09.160000 :  Now, it's not the case, I would say.
0:35:12.160000 :  And correct me if you think otherwise.
0:35:15.160000 :  But this characterizes all philosophy classes.
0:35:18.160000 :  It's easy, actually, to give you a counterexample.
0:35:21.160000 :  The class that you took, you were one of the most active students.
0:35:25.160000 :  Which class?
0:35:27.160000 :  I'm thinking of the history of philosophy.
0:35:30.160000 :  Oh, I see.
0:35:31.160000 :  You were sitting in the front and you were definitely one of the most active students.
0:35:35.160000 :  But and only active female students?
0:35:40.160000 :  Well, I mean, there were, so proportionally, maybe you're right.
0:35:47.160000 :  But to say that, you know, it's dominated by male students is not entirely correct.
0:35:51.160000 :  Because now and again, you do have female students who are active.
0:35:58.160000 :  As I'm thinking of different classes, you know, well, that's the case.
0:36:03.160000 :  And as I mentioned, a number of female students who went through the CHK program,
0:36:08.160000 :  the undergraduate program, the M4 student, they were M4 students here.
0:36:12.160000 :  They went on to study philosophy elsewhere, which is not easy to do, to get into programs.
0:36:19.160000 :  Some of them were active and were very successful.
0:36:23.160000 :  There is something else also at Harvard.
0:36:28.160000 :  It's by far not always the case that those students who are most active are the smartest students
0:36:36.160000 :  or the students who end up getting the best grades.
0:36:39.160000 :  I would say for the most part, that's not the case.
0:36:44.160000 :  I remember that always when I arrived, there were more international students
0:36:47.160000 :  than in the general education program.
0:36:50.160000 :  And you had all the Western students that were, you know, very active.
0:36:54.160000 :  As soon as I asked a question, their hands up, you know.
0:36:57.160000 :  But the result was that actually they didn't do as well as many local students who were very diligent.
0:37:06.160000 :  You know, I remember when I was an undergraduate student, I had, you know,
0:37:10.160000 :  the professors used different language then.
0:37:13.160000 :  And my professors in Europe, in Lithuania, were full of irony.
0:37:18.160000 :  There was a lot of irony in Lithuania.
0:37:20.160000 :  And one professor used to say, in this class, we'll make a big exception.
0:37:25.160000 :  We will think before we talk.
0:37:28.160000 :  That was the idea that, you know, in philosophy, you need time to think matters through before you engage.
0:37:33.160000 :  So these are the two things that came to my mind when I was reading.
0:37:36.160000 :  I was surprised, you know, with this idea that the students are the most active students,
0:37:41.160000 :  those who speak most, presumably, you know, that can mean anything.
0:37:48.160000 :  I think they might be not.
0:37:49.160000 :  Yeah. But the issue we concern the most is the social life of the students.
0:37:57.160000 :  And I think it brought us to the favoritism part.
0:38:03.160000 :  I find it actually quite interesting that the atmosphere in the department encourages favoritism.
0:38:12.160000 :  So let's say you have a student who talks a lot in tutorial classes,
0:38:18.160000 :  who is rebutting everyone's arguments, and his peers will soon see this very vocal student
0:38:30.160000 :  as somebody who is more able in philosophy and perhaps is a very good student, a very smart student.
0:38:39.160000 :  And you start to admire him more.
0:38:43.160000 :  And we find that this actually is quite a common mentality that is in many philosophy students.
0:38:56.160000 :  So quantitative wise, those who spoke in tutorial classes are male.
0:39:03.160000 :  And I know some students, maybe like Yilun Han herself, who taught in tutorial,
0:39:09.160000 :  but quantitative wise, those who spoke more are male.
0:39:12.160000 :  So it causes the consequence of this was students tend to admire male students more
0:39:24.160000 :  and tend to admire female students less.
0:39:27.160000 :  And this has caused an issue to female students in their social lives.
0:39:32.160000 :  I can use an example.
0:39:36.160000 :  One of our interviewees were female students who was in a relationship with a high achiever in philosophy classes.
0:39:50.160000 :  A postgraduate student.
0:39:53.160000 :  Postgraduate students. Right.
0:39:56.160000 :  And people in her peers field are interviewing as a subordinate to her boyfriend,
0:40:13.160000 :  and not as an equal to her boyfriend.
0:40:17.160000 :  She felt very uncomfortable with the idea that her classmates seemed her as somebody, as nobody.
0:40:26.160000 :  Right.
0:40:27.160000 :  But after she got her PhD offer, those people who admire her boyfriend come to admire her,
0:40:35.160000 :  and it makes her feel sick.
0:40:38.160000 :  Right. Well, which the whole scenario speaks to the issue that I was just saying,
0:40:42.160000 :  I think that it's by far not always the case that those who speak most are the most brilliant students.
0:40:48.160000 :  Very often it's quite different.
0:40:51.160000 :  But in general, so that's just generally I would say, most definitely.
0:40:55.160000 :  I would say it about every class that I've taught.
0:40:59.160000 :  Very often you have students who will be much more quiet, but when you see they were, you cannot believe it.
0:41:09.160000 :  On one occasion I had to invite a student to talk to me because I was sure it was plagiarism,
0:41:13.160000 :  and later I found out it was not, because I started asking all the questions.
0:41:17.160000 :  I was really surprised because I had never heard the students speak.
0:41:22.160000 :  In general, you're right.
0:41:24.160000 :  Male students speak more, right, as I think now also of some of the best female students that I've had over the years,
0:41:33.160000 :  who I mentioned are doing so well, publishing in top journals in the field,
0:41:38.160000 :  while they are still students remarkably well, taking part in all the conferences and so on and so forth,
0:41:42.160000 :  learning different languages and impressing colleagues all around the world.
0:41:47.160000 :  Now that I think about it, yes, I had a similar experience.
0:41:50.160000 :  They were quite quiet, and then they would have to make a tutorial presentation.
0:41:54.160000 :  I just couldn't believe how good it was.
0:41:56.160000 :  It was a surprise.
0:41:58.160000 :  So maybe that also falls, you know, one of the interviewees was speaking of different quality traits of women and men.
0:42:10.160000 :  I don't know, I'm not a psychologist, but given this kind of dynamic we are discussing,
0:42:16.160000 :  maybe another quality trait is this manner too.
0:42:25.160000 :  I'm not sure.
0:42:26.160000 :  But in general, you know, there is, you know, okay, one of the things that it's good for us to hear these details
0:42:34.160000 :  because, you know, once we know them, we can start thinking how to address them, right,
0:42:39.160000 :  because if we don't know, we cannot address them.
0:42:41.160000 :  So as I mentioned with these, you know, really horrible comments, you know, so we had no idea, you know.
0:42:48.160000 :  But so one of the things that the department is planning to do is actually form a committee to deal with these very problems.
0:42:58.160000 :  To deal with what problems?
0:43:00.160000 :  To deal with gender-related issues.
0:43:04.160000 :  So we don't have an exact name for the committee yet because it's hard to form committees over the summer
0:43:09.160000 :  because colleagues are, you know, in various places, right?
0:43:12.160000 :  And as I mentioned, we are a democratic department and it needs to be approved by certain committees, you know.
0:43:17.160000 :  So these are all very good details for us to hear because these are the kind of details that the committee would look,
0:43:25.160000 :  think how to address people, students, right, you know.
0:43:29.160000 :  Yeah.
0:43:30.160000 :  The kind of inquiry that you guys are doing right now is in fact very much the kind that we will be conducting as well.
0:43:37.160000 :  In some respects.
0:43:38.160000 :  Absolutely.
0:43:39.160000 :  In this regard, that's why I say you guys are partners in this.
0:43:42.160000 :  The information that you held turned up is so invaluable for us because we really have the same goal of making things better for everyone in the department
0:43:51.160000 :  and improving the environment here.
0:43:53.160000 :  And we need to know these things before we can act on them and start to initiate change.
0:43:57.160000 :  You know, so what we would just to add to what Professor Kiwa was saying,
0:44:02.160000 :  what I would very much like to see is that when it comes to this ad hoc committee,
0:44:06.160000 :  that we also have some students, you know, both postgraduate and undergraduate, as part of this committee.
0:44:13.160000 :  The only way to address this problem is to work together.
0:44:17.160000 :  There is no other way because otherwise we don't, as you said, what is the problem?
0:44:21.160000 :  You know, well, I will know the problem, but it's the same problem if we talk about it.
0:44:25.160000 :  Otherwise, I don't know.
0:44:26.160000 :  Right.
0:44:27.160000 :  Yeah.
0:44:28.160000 :  I'm also aware that there's going to be some transition or turnover in the philosophy society.
0:44:34.160000 :  Maybe even a kind of dissolution and reconstruction of that.
0:44:37.160000 :  And that could be a really good moment of opportunity to think about changing the culture in the department
0:44:43.160000 :  and making sure that everyone has a stake and that their voice is being heard in constructing the kind of environment
0:44:49.160000 :  that is more representative of, you know, a 40% female student makeup.
0:44:56.160000 :  If that's, you know, that's the number of students we have.
0:44:59.160000 :  And even if it's not that number, we would want our female students to feel like their voices are heard,
0:45:04.160000 :  like the culture that's shaped here is one that they belong to as much as anyone else.
0:45:08.160000 :  Of course.
0:45:09.160000 :  Of course, yeah.
0:45:10.160000 :  Yeah, just also a very important point that you are making right now,
0:45:13.160000 :  just to add, if, you know, if this message could be passed on to the students that they should look for,
0:45:19.160000 :  you know, there will be meetings that will be held about the new philosophy society,
0:45:22.160000 :  because as you probably know, there is no philosophical society now.
0:45:25.160000 :  Yeah.
0:45:26.160000 :  And you know, there is no, there are no people who express an interest.
0:45:29.160000 :  So there is something happening, you know, with a student body that hasn't happened in the past.
0:45:35.160000 :  And the department wants to get involved in this, you know, to bring alumni, you know,
0:45:39.160000 :  to get many parties involved, to speak about what, you know, the society is,
0:45:42.160000 :  because maybe we are dealing with the result of post-COVID years,
0:45:45.160000 :  where the society couldn't function for many years, right?
0:45:48.160000 :  So people don't have the living memory of how it functioned.
0:45:52.160000 :  But at least keep, it would be really great if people kept their eyes peeled,
0:45:57.160000 :  because when it comes to discussions about the composition of the, you know, the student society,
0:46:03.160000 :  we would very much like to hear students who have these concerns,
0:46:06.160000 :  or who consider, you know, this an important issue, to speak out and say,
0:46:11.160000 :  I'm sure everybody will be very happy to include that,
0:46:14.160000 :  because that's the whole idea of a student society.
0:46:18.160000 :  We haven't considered much about the student society in the philosophy department, right?
0:46:25.160000 :  Oh, can you say again?
0:46:27.160000 :  We haven't considered much of the student society in the philosophy department?
0:46:42.160000 :  We tried to reach out to some, I guess, ex-member of the philosophy society for statistics,
0:46:50.160000 :  and what's your question again?
0:46:55.160000 :  About the philosophical society, right?
0:46:58.160000 :  I think we didn't consider them much before.
0:47:04.160000 :  We only contacted them for statistics of the students.
0:47:10.160000 :  Yeah.
0:47:11.160000 :  It might be also interesting to see the composition of the society.
0:47:15.160000 :  Who, where, you know, the representatives, who was the secretary, right, in terms of gender distribution.
0:47:23.160000 :  Because of course, the philosophical society is a society that is elected by the students.
0:47:29.160000 :  So in that regard, that might speak of a general issue.
0:47:34.160000 :  We discussed it.
0:47:37.160000 :  We talked about female scholars before, so I'd like to know,
0:47:44.160000 :  do you think female academics face more challenges in philosophy, in academia, in general?
0:47:53.160000 :  Yeah, I would say traditionally that was the case.
0:47:57.160000 :  My general sense is that worldwide, the situation has improved in very important ways.
0:48:05.160000 :  So also if we just consider, say, statistically,
0:48:10.160000 :  the number of male and female candidates who have gotten positions recently in philosophy.
0:48:19.160000 :  I haven't looked into the statistics myself, but one thing is that I'm sure that there are many more
0:48:26.160000 :  female candidates getting positions now, statistically, than say 20 years ago or 30 years ago.
0:48:33.160000 :  That there would be no comparison.
0:48:36.160000 :  And the reason for that is that for a number of years now already,
0:48:39.160000 :  there is the awareness of the issues that we have discussed.
0:48:46.160000 :  So historically, yes indeed so.
0:48:49.160000 :  Now my general sense is that this issue is definitely improving.
0:48:56.160000 :  It remains complex in that everything Saul said is correct.
0:49:00.160000 :  There's still the problems within broader philosophy cultures that you guys are touching on
0:49:05.160000 :  that might make for challenges for women to advance their careers
0:49:10.160000 :  at the same time as there's more support and more encouragement
0:49:14.160000 :  and maybe a bit of preference in the job market.
0:49:16.160000 :  So those two things exist.
0:49:18.160000 :  It's absolutely correct that a woman who has exceeded in her career and is doing well
0:49:23.160000 :  has a very, very good chance on the philosophy job market.
0:49:26.160000 :  But it also remains true that she may encounter challenges along the way
0:49:30.160000 :  like the ones that you guys have described in broader cultures of philosophy.
0:49:35.160000 :  Yeah. Maybe different philosophical fields are also different.
0:49:39.160000 :  I mainly work in phenomenology.
0:49:42.160000 :  And as I'm thinking about it now, of course I know the people who get positions worldwide.
0:49:47.160000 :  And actually, over the last, I would say seven years,
0:49:50.160000 :  there are more female colleagues who landed positions in phenomenology than me.
0:49:54.160000 :  Twenty, thirty years ago, it would have been, you know, that was different.
0:49:58.160000 :  But there were also female colleagues who had positions, sure, you know, but statistically.
0:50:03.160000 :  So the station has changed dramatically.
0:50:06.160000 :  But yes, of course, you know, the picture itself is complicated, of course.
0:50:10.160000 :  It is just, you know, when I think about it in general, if one looks into the details,
0:50:18.160000 :  there are so many components, of course, and it's important to attend to them.
0:50:23.160000 :  What kind of philosophical culture causes less female enterer philosophy academia?
0:50:31.160000 :  Well, you guys are alluding to some of the issues in the article,
0:50:35.160000 :  and I know it's just in a kind of sketchy form right now.
0:50:38.160000 :  But you've talked, for example, about, we're speaking very generally here,
0:50:43.160000 :  but I do grant that from my understanding of the psychological research,
0:50:47.160000 :  it corroborates what you guys have been describing,
0:50:50.160000 :  which is that typically there are preferences for things people are interested in
0:50:55.160000 :  and modes of communication and expression where there's a bit of a statistical variation between men and women.
0:51:01.160000 :  And that the way that we communicate, express ourselves, share ideas in philosophy departments
0:51:08.160000 :  has typically favored male, typically male ways of communicating and expressing,
0:51:14.160000 :  and that that sometimes makes women feel less comfortable in those spaces.
0:51:18.160000 :  Again, huge generalizations here, but when you're looking at understanding swaths of statistics,
0:51:24.160000 :  it helps to make some sense out of those.
0:51:27.160000 :  So, yeah, if voices are not heard, they don't get a chance to show themselves
0:51:32.160000 :  and to get the attention and the opportunity that they maybe deserve at an earlier moment.
0:51:37.160000 :  Maybe a female student that's transferred out of a philosophy department, ours or others,
0:51:42.160000 :  because that issue of female students transferring out is also, you know,
0:51:46.160000 :  not unique to CUHK, maybe some of those students would have gone on to be great academic philosophers,
0:51:53.160000 :  wonderful colleagues for us, but because of, you know,
0:51:56.160000 :  historical ways that philosophy is expressed in professional academic philosophy,
0:52:01.160000 :  they said, oh, that's not the place for me. I'm going to go to a different area.
0:52:05.160000 :  And that's a loss for us, for our discipline, for this small group of philosophers here,
0:52:10.160000 :  for the students that we have here.
0:52:12.160000 :  So finding ways to change those cultures and make sure that everyone feels like their voice is welcome
0:52:19.160000 :  and is being heard is a priority.
0:52:23.160000 :  It's also the most difficult part of what we've talked about today.
0:52:28.160000 :  Like hiring a female colleague is hard. We're clearly struggling, but we're making it a priority.
0:52:33.160000 :  We know exactly what we need to accomplish and we're throwing everything at it.
0:52:38.160000 :  And if the problems with culture among the students were just things like explicit sexism,
0:52:44.160000 :  you know, some students saying things like women belong in the kitchen.
0:52:48.160000 :  Well, I feel like we could focus on that and say like that is intolerable.
0:52:53.160000 :  But when it comes to these more subtle issues of how we express ourselves in the classroom,
0:52:57.160000 :  whose voice get heard and whose doesn't, let me put it a different way.
0:53:03.160000 :  When you describe the situation of favoritism, which you described as favoritism,
0:53:07.160000 :  between a female and a male student, and the one speaks a lot in class and is very highly esteemed by peers,
0:53:14.160000 :  whereas the female student is not speaking as much and might be just as excellent,
0:53:19.160000 :  but feels like she isn't able to express and hear herself.
0:53:23.160000 :  Let me put it like this. If you were teaching the class, what would you do differently?
0:53:30.160000 :  And I'm not saying there isn't anything we can do. There are things we can do.
0:53:34.160000 :  And we're thinking about this. We'll be having these kinds of conversations.
0:53:38.160000 :  But just to have you see it from our side, what would you do differently?
0:53:45.160000 :  Should I call on that female student and say, hey, you talk more?
0:53:49.160000 :  I haven't heard your voice. I want to know if you're as excellent as that guy over there.
0:53:53.160000 :  You talk more. No. This is not a good solution.
0:53:57.160000 :  I've thought of this problem. So I wouldn't attribute the issue to the lecturer,
0:54:05.160000 :  but rather it's the culture among the students. I could imagine it could have been otherwise.
0:54:16.160000 :  I can imagine the case that students do not assume that students would talk very aggressively
0:54:29.160000 :  as being a grade-back student.
0:54:35.160000 :  If the culture among students encourage collaboration, the situation could have been better.
0:54:47.160000 :  For example, the norm right now is students would just throw out their arguments
0:55:10.160000 :  and then others would fight against it. If you can successfully defend a position,
0:55:16.160000 :  then others would feel you as a good student, a philosophically able student.
0:55:24.160000 :  But it could have been another way. I could imagine a situation where students just actively build upon each other's views
0:55:32.160000 :  and then maybe construct a more well-rounded position relative to a tutorial class.
0:55:39.160000 :  I see it as absolutely possible as an alternative to the current situation,
0:55:45.160000 :  where it could invite more female students to join in the discussion,
0:55:50.160000 :  and they wouldn't feel repelled from the more aggressive comments from their male teachers.
0:56:00.160000 :  So I would say the problem is not in how the lecture is done, but rather in the culture among the students.
0:56:08.160000 :  I think that has been a lingering problem that causes all these gender issues in my own perspective.
0:56:18.160000 :  But that's how I see the problem. It's the culture that causes all these issues among male and female students.
0:56:31.160000 :  Would you say that the same problem has emerged because the department has different orientations?
0:56:40.160000 :  It's right. Anglo-American, Chinese, Continental.
0:56:46.160000 :  Is the problem the same in the lectures or seminars in these different groups of classes?
0:56:59.160000 :  What's your question, Ken?
0:57:01.160000 :  So we have different kinds of classes. So the problem that you are describing, I would describe it as follows, or adding on it.
0:57:07.160000 :  So a colleague from another country came to give a talk.
0:57:11.160000 :  I wrote to him an email expressing appreciation and clarifying why I thought the talk was great.
0:57:20.160000 :  He was so surprised. He said, you know, in philosophy nowadays, and he came from a world of learning,
0:57:26.160000 :  in philosophy nowadays there are only two reactions, either indifference or somebody starting to kill you.
0:57:34.160000 :  But I would say this kind of combative spirit does not characterize all philosophical traditions.
0:57:40.160000 :  That's my question, you see, what I'm getting at.
0:57:43.160000 :  And I wonder whether tutorials or discussions are led differently within different traditions.
0:57:52.160000 :  I can certainly see how within certain philosophical traditions the question would be not telling me why this person is wrong,
0:58:01.160000 :  but telling me why this is important. Articulate, elaborate. What implications follow.
0:58:11.160000 :  So it much depends on questions that are being asked, but within different philosophical traditions, you know, tradition,
0:58:17.160000 :  anyone has quite different questions.
0:58:20.160000 :  In our philosophical traditions, from Robin's gathered, currently in the student circle,
0:58:32.160000 :  the philosophical tradition that is popular these days is analytic philosophy.
0:58:40.160000 :  I know that the department has a one third continental, one third Chinese, one third analytic,
0:58:51.160000 :  but among students, analytic philosophy was the thing.
0:58:55.160000 :  And 20 years ago, it was Chinese philosophy and continental philosophy,
0:59:01.160000 :  but we have observed that issues like these, gender issues we have been discussing, were prevalent in the past and current.
0:59:15.160000 :  So I do not think it's a problem of philosophical traditions.
0:59:22.160000 :  So say it's in all traditions.
0:59:25.160000 :  This is probably the word.
0:59:33.160000 :  That's where we have mentioned about the locker room culture.
0:59:36.160000 :  And in the past, there's a circle, students would form different circles.
0:59:43.160000 :  This circle is formed among Chinese philosophy students, this is formed among continental students.
0:59:50.160000 :  And nowadays, we have also observed there's an analytic philosophy circle.
0:59:56.160000 :  And in this circle is really what created these locker rooms, because they echoed different each other,
1:00:08.160000 :  patting each other in the back, which is what we think contributed to gender issues in the past.
1:00:21.160000 :  Calvin, what you said about the combative character of that culture, I think was very perceptive.
1:00:28.160000 :  And I think the remark from the overseas colleagues that you emailed is also very telling.
1:00:35.160000 :  It's not just among our students.
1:00:38.160000 :  There has been something that's settled into the way of doing philosophy and academic philosophy.
1:00:44.160000 :  It's not the only way, it's not everyone who does it that way, but something of this combative spirit,
1:00:50.160000 :  thinking that that's the way philosophy is to be done, has kind of settled into the norm.
1:00:55.160000 :  And I would say many of us were probably educated in that kind of culture as well,
1:01:00.160000 :  and proved ourselves and came to show that we're able philosophers in that kind of culture as well.
1:01:06.160000 :  So becoming aware as educators that there are other ways to conduct philosophical discourse that are more constructive,
1:01:15.160000 :  that involve building on one another's ideas more than trying to knock them down,
1:01:19.160000 :  different metaphors and models of philosophical discourse is really important.
1:01:24.160000 :  Now, how without saying who does what in which classes,
1:01:29.160000 :  when we have people who are maybe teaching in that way and contributing to that culture,
1:01:35.160000 :  how to change that, it's very difficult because even if we want to bring about change in the culture,
1:01:42.160000 :  it's very difficult to mandate that teachers change the way they teach in classes.
1:01:49.160000 :  But this is an issue that we'll be sensitive to as we're looking into this and thinking about how we go about changing our culture here.
1:01:57.160000 :  Okay, now, so okay, then we would like to look into part that is perhaps a bit more sensitive.
1:02:21.160000 :  We have heard from some of our interviewees regarding the issue of sexual harassment between the department,
1:02:29.160000 :  and we would like to know more about it.
1:02:32.160000 :  And would you perhaps want to say something about that?
1:02:37.160000 :  If there is sexual harassment, how will the department deal with it?
1:02:45.160000 :  So obviously when it comes to the details, it's something that we cannot enter into because those details are confidential.
1:02:54.160000 :  It would be extremely, anytime you would address with a student or a colleague or anybody issues of this kind,
1:03:04.160000 :  you would always say anything that you say will stay with me.
1:03:08.160000 :  So the last thing, right, that one can do then is address this issue so that anybody can read about it.
1:03:14.160000 :  So the details cannot be, you know, we cannot enter into the details.
1:03:19.160000 :  Now, to the best of my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong,
1:03:25.160000 :  obviously no faculty member was ever either accused or convicted, so to speak, of sexual harassment.
1:03:38.160000 :  Now, second, can I just ask, does that corroborate what you guys have heard?
1:03:44.160000 :  Have you heard anything other than what Professor Gainius just said?
1:03:50.160000 :  Well, we haven't heard of any philosophy department members harassing other people,
1:03:59.160000 :  but we have heard cases of sexual harassment from our interviewees.
1:04:08.160000 :  Between students, yeah. We just wanted to clarify that.
1:04:13.160000 :  Actually, I cannot show what I heard is sexual harassment, but I heard from, actually she's not one of our interviewees.
1:04:27.160000 :  She's just my friend, but she's also in the department.
1:04:30.160000 :  But she has built a very close relationship with one of the department members.
1:04:40.160000 :  Department member?
1:04:43.160000 :  Yeah, and I feel concerned because I'm not sure whether she can protect herself very well.
1:04:52.160000 :  So not a student?
1:04:54.160000 :  Not a student, but a department member.
1:04:59.160000 :  Actually, she's a visiting professor.
1:05:07.160000 :  But nothing really serious has happened, I would say.
1:05:12.160000 :  But it makes me think another issue is that when some faculty members want to help a student,
1:05:21.160000 :  how can we prevent the students from being a victim of the relationship?
1:05:26.160000 :  Right. This is completely new to me. I haven't heard of that.
1:05:33.160000 :  What can a department do, and what should a department do?
1:05:42.160000 :  Obviously, a department should do what other departments do, either here or at other universities.
1:05:48.160000 :  There is a procedure.
1:05:51.160000 :  We are not trained to deal with issues of this age.
1:05:58.160000 :  We don't have the background either to deal with the trauma that very often results from these kinds of experiences,
1:06:06.160000 :  or even we don't have the legal training to qualify X as X or Y as Y.
1:06:16.160000 :  But, like all other universities, CHK as well has an office, and the office is an office of sexual harassment.
1:06:24.160000 :  Now, what is of importance? I would always encourage students to let us know.
1:06:31.160000 :  They don't feel comfortable to speak to male colleagues, to general office members.
1:06:38.160000 :  The step that we would take is not only would we make contact with this office,
1:06:47.160000 :  ask the office to contact a student rather than the other way around,
1:06:51.160000 :  but we would really encourage the student to address the office,
1:06:56.160000 :  because they are the ones with the training to deal with problems of this age.
1:07:07.160000 :  What we would do, besides showing concern, which of course would be, trust me, genuine,
1:07:17.160000 :  because these kinds of things are really both shocking and something that should be completely not tolerated at any department.
1:07:28.160000 :  But the real, to address the problem, you need people with a training.
1:07:33.160000 :  So this is what I can say when it comes to the details, these kinds of things.
1:07:40.160000 :  When it comes to some confidential conversations, confidential conversations have to say confidential.
1:07:46.160000 :  So the procedure is if a student were sexually harassed, she need to come to the general office and report harassment?
1:07:57.160000 :  We would want to know that, that's right, that's right.
1:08:00.160000 :  There are different ways to deal with it. She can also report it to the police. It's a crime.
1:08:07.160000 :  But the university would not say, oh, talk to the police, we don't have anything to do with that.
1:08:12.160000 :  They would say, no, no, we have an office to deal with issues like that.
1:08:16.160000 :  So these offices can address both matters relating to sexual harassment as well as help the student psychologically.
1:08:27.160000 :  Because very often these kinds of events result in a deep trial.
1:08:32.160000 :  To the best of my knowledge, so again, no colleague was ever accused, actually accused of sexual harassment.
1:08:40.160000 :  To say nothing of any committee's decision that was a case of sexual harassment.
1:08:48.160000 :  To the best of my knowledge, no student.
1:08:51.160000 :  We don't have a case where we could say this case is to be labeled as sexual harassment.
1:08:59.160000 :  The committees looked into that and this is the decision that they reached.
1:09:05.160000 :  To the best of my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong.
1:09:08.160000 :  You mean the committee has never decided that sexual harassment happened in the philosophy department?
1:09:16.160000 :  Yes, because when it comes to issues like that, there are committees with any kind of allegation in a port of law.
1:09:28.160000 :  If I say that you stole money from me, somebody needs to ascertain this truly happened.
1:09:33.160000 :  So in this particular case as well.
1:09:37.160000 :  Because otherwise you will have instances of witch hunting where people will just say whatever they want and that will be enough.
1:09:46.160000 :  So obviously that's not the legal way to proceed.
1:09:49.160000 :  There must be committees who establish the case.
1:09:54.160000 :  So that's to the best of my knowledge.
1:09:56.160000 :  But again, that aside, when students run into these kind of problems, it's very important for them just not to keep it in themselves.
1:10:07.160000 :  That doesn't help. Very often problems will continue.
1:10:11.160000 :  So that's really not a step to take.
1:10:14.160000 :  And there are institutions as well as offices that are there to help.
1:10:19.160000 :  So for instance, even if it comes to establishing or not establishing that this case should be labeled this way or another way or a third way, even that aside, the offices will search for ways to help the student under the circumstances.
1:10:35.160000 :  But one of our interviews has reported that the students who are in the office are not being helped.
1:10:42.160000 :  They are being helped by the department.
1:10:45.160000 :  But one of our interviews has reported that she feels reluctant to report to the department because she feel, I don't know how to put it, but she just don't trust the department and the anti-sexual harassment committee in the university.
1:11:09.160000 :  Because she complained about the procedure there.
1:11:13.160000 :  She said the procedure required her and who committed the sexual harassment to be in the same room and talk to each other to solve the problem.
1:11:28.160000 :  And she also said that because the social worker there does not understand the atmosphere and community in the philosophy department.
1:11:37.160000 :  So they may not be very able to help her.
1:11:41.160000 :  That makes the station very difficult.
1:11:45.160000 :  Because as with any other crime, crime needs to be reported if it is to be addressed as crime.
1:11:56.160000 :  If it is not reported, who is going to help? How?
1:12:01.160000 :  So then you get into this very difficult situation.
1:12:04.160000 :  And honestly, I also understand the complexity of this situation.
1:12:09.160000 :  Because very often there are reasons why, let's not necessarily focus on female students.
1:12:15.160000 :  Females in general don't want to talk about that.
1:12:19.160000 :  So a terribly complicated matter, to say the least.
1:12:25.160000 :  But from the department side, the only way in which we can try to help is if we know.
1:12:32.160000 :  If we don't know, there is nothing we can do.
1:12:35.160000 :  We don't have how, what kind of magical channels we will obtain.
1:12:42.160000 :  And what we would do is what universities have these offices for this purpose.
1:12:50.160000 :  So like last year, this coming year also, there will be information that will be circulated among the students.
1:12:59.160000 :  We did that last year.
1:13:00.160000 :  Not only the information came from the offices, but also from the department.
1:13:06.160000 :  Saying that these kind of details are not being tolerated.
1:13:09.160000 :  But generally, when we don't have a complete case to deal with.
1:13:17.160000 :  I'm not sure what else we can do.
1:13:22.160000 :  If you have ideas, that would be very good to hear.
1:13:26.160000 :  That's what we were saying earlier, that when it comes to these kinds of matters, it's important to work together.
1:13:31.160000 :  So if we refer the students to the Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee, is there anything else that the department can do for the students?
1:13:44.160000 :  To the best of my knowledge, there are two channels.
1:13:48.160000 :  The committee and, it depends on the case, police.
1:13:56.160000 :  So if there is violence, the student should call the police.
1:14:02.160000 :  If there is any kind of violence.
1:14:05.160000 :  Now, we are not policemen, right?
1:14:09.160000 :  We are members of the committee. We don't have the training.
1:14:12.160000 :  So we'll be happy to talk to the student, of course.
1:14:16.160000 :  It's crucial in water for us that those things don't happen.
1:14:20.160000 :  But it's good that there are people with the training to deal with that.
1:14:26.160000 :  Otherwise we would be dealing with that as amateurs.
1:14:30.160000 :  I'm noting down your question and will continue to ask it.
1:14:35.160000 :  But right now, what Salvi just said, we're pretty limited.
1:14:43.160000 :  But we'll think more about that. I'm not sure if there's anything more that we can do.
1:14:47.160000 :  There are certain things that we can do. But there are smaller things.
1:14:50.160000 :  We can try to limit the contact between the two students to a degree.
1:15:03.160000 :  We cannot prohibit any students who are not officially accused of anything from taking classes.
1:15:12.160000 :  Of course we cannot do that.
1:15:14.160000 :  But when it comes to setting up tutorial groups, things like that.
1:15:20.160000 :  Because in such instances, I can imagine for some students it can be a problem that the contact is still there.
1:15:28.160000 :  If the student is the same here, they continue to take the same classes because they go through the program.
1:15:33.160000 :  So the department can help, but it's a small thing to limit the contact.
1:15:39.160000 :  But we need to know the need.
1:15:44.160000 :  When we bring up the issue of sexual harassment, we bring it up not because of it.
1:15:51.160000 :  Just because among our students, we have felt that problems like sexual harassment are a bit more prevalent within the philosophy department than other departments.
1:16:05.160000 :  Right?
1:16:07.160000 :  It's more prevalent, more common in the philosophy department?
1:16:15.160000 :  More common? I'm not sure.
1:16:20.160000 :  We would need to publish articles about various departments, right?
1:16:24.160000 :  To establish this.
1:16:27.160000 :  But the problem is, look, that's not to close our eyes to the problem.
1:16:31.160000 :  If there are accusations, again, in many cases we're established to the best of my knowledge.
1:16:37.160000 :  But if there are accusations, this needs to be taken very, very seriously.
1:16:41.160000 :  And the steps that I mentioned is I would be very happy to hear from the students, as Aidan mentioned, let's not note this down.
1:16:51.160000 :  Let's talk, let's see. Maybe students will have ideas.
1:16:54.160000 :  Sometimes it so happens that you talk to the students and, well, you know, you don't get complete suggestions.
1:17:02.160000 :  Which is understandable because it's a difficult matter. Right?
1:17:06.160000 :  It's a very difficult matter.
1:17:09.160000 :  So, let one thing is clear, those kinds of things are zero tolerance. For sure. For sure.
1:17:18.160000 :  And that's also one of the reasons why it's very important that we know about it.
1:17:25.160000 :  I remember one of our interviewees said, even though sexual harassment in the law enforcement department is not unique,
1:17:35.160000 :  like it happens in other departments too, but what is unique is it's very hard for females to seek for help.
1:17:43.160000 :  Because they feel reluctant to talk to their male professors because she feels it is harder for them to...
1:17:54.160000 :  They don't understand, right?
1:17:56.160000 :  Yeah, and they are afraid to be judged.
1:18:01.160000 :  Well, I mean, it's...
1:18:06.160000 :  From my own perspective, as I was just saying, these are the things that we cannot tolerate.
1:18:13.160000 :  So when it comes to understanding, you know, now these concerns that a male faculty member won't understand,
1:18:24.160000 :  hopefully when we have female colleagues, students will feel more comfortable to address them.
1:18:33.160000 :  In the meantime, under the current composition, again, the suggestion that I would make is talk to general office.
1:18:42.160000 :  The general offices, they are unbelievably helpful people, really unbelievably.
1:18:50.160000 :  And then, you know, if there is a channel at the university, they will also know about it.
1:18:56.160000 :  They are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to these matters.
1:19:00.160000 :  So if a person is unwilling to talk to a male faculty member, talking to the general offices and adults...
1:19:09.160000 :  And in the future, hopefully, we'll have female colleagues, and hopefully, students will feel more comfortable.
1:19:16.160000 :  But I really don't want anybody talking about it in the sense that I don't want this to be happening.
1:19:23.160000 :  So we need to create such a culture where such things don't happen.
1:19:27.160000 :  This is really, you know...
1:19:33.160000 :  This is really challenging. And for so many levels.
1:19:38.160000 :  I would say the problem that we are discussing is, as I mentioned, a priority for the department right now.
1:19:47.160000 :  There is another big problem within the department and within the university, or whole family, I would say.
1:19:52.160000 :  And that has to do with depression and psychic health. Not only depression, also psychic health.
1:20:03.160000 :  To what degree these two instances are linked to each other?
1:20:11.160000 :  I cannot say, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a link.
1:20:15.160000 :  Simply because, you know...
1:20:21.160000 :  There are certain things that a normal person would not know.
1:20:27.160000 :  So the problem is very deep. But we need to know the problem if we have to address it.
1:20:32.160000 :  And these are the channels that I mentioned earlier, where the department can be.
1:20:36.160000 :  I want to look at this, also, from one part into a few.
1:20:44.160000 :  We have heard that, from our interview, he thinks that the perpetrator of a central harassment would only try to harass a female student only if he felt safe to do so.
1:21:08.160000 :  So what he was implying was that the atmosphere in the philosophy department, in some sense, not encouraged, but allowed him to feel safe in doing whatever he did before, whatever those offenders did.
1:21:27.160000 :  I'm just quoting from him, because I'm not sure if he's...
1:21:41.160000 :  I'm not sure about this, but I just want to hear from you. What do you think about if the philosophy department has, perhaps, by its culture or in some other way,
1:21:57.160000 :  enabled people to feel safe to do so?
1:22:03.160000 :  So two things briefly that I would say, and then maybe you can add further reflections.
1:22:09.160000 :  First thing, that's an obvious case of false perception. This would not be tolerated. That's the first thing.
1:22:17.160000 :  And second, it's very sad that there is such a false perception.
1:22:19.160000 :  The students think that, you know, no, it would be okay. Everybody would be okay with that. It wouldn't be. Of course, we wouldn't tolerate that.
1:22:28.160000 :  So these are the two thoughts. Three, two, three, two thoughts.
1:22:35.160000 :  How to deal with that? Well, there is no short, quick, simple, magic answer. There are a number of steps that we need to take.
1:22:46.160000 :  Hiring female colleagues is one of them.
1:22:50.160000 :  Passing on the information to students at various levels of what is permitted and what is not permitted is another thing.
1:23:03.160000 :  Yeah, and then talking to you, you know, to all of you and seeing what we can all do together to change these negative aspects of the student culture.
1:23:13.160000 :  Yeah, my general response is the same.
1:23:20.160000 :  Unless there's a bit more elaboration of what the allegation of enabling is, when you use the language of enabling and say something has maybe been done to make someone feel like they can do that.
1:23:34.160000 :  I would need to understand what exactly is being suggested in that to be able to give a more specific answer.
1:23:40.160000 :  But certainly no one here is okay with that. If that's the question, it's not okay.
1:23:46.160000 :  So it must be suggesting something more subtle that has or has not been done to make that person feel safe.
1:23:54.160000 :  If there's more to say to that, we could respond to a more specific claim. But in its general form, it's not okay. No one here thinks it's okay.
1:24:03.160000 :  If we knew the details, then we could at least see what we could possibly do about it. But we would not let it go.
1:24:13.160000 :  I wasn't in that interview, but perhaps you could.
1:24:19.160000 :  Do you remember clearly what he said in that interview?
1:24:23.160000 :  Okay.
1:24:43.160000 :  I don't remember his exact words. Maybe we need to ask for more details.
1:24:50.160000 :  Okay.
1:24:53.160000 :  Then I just want to know what the department is planning to do just in order to respond to all of these problems.
1:25:08.160000 :  You have mentioned perhaps hiring female professors, communicating with students like us, and maybe just spread the information about what students can do and cannot do.
1:25:26.160000 :  Is there anything else in the department's agenda to improve issues?
1:25:32.160000 :  Another thing that I mentioned among other things is forming an ad hoc committee that would look into this matter in greater detail.
1:25:44.160000 :  We would be so pleased to hear from the student body what the students...
1:25:52.160000 :  The way we talk is that there are a number of allusions, but we don't know the details.
1:25:56.160000 :  So if the students came up with suggestions, and if somebody said to us, here is what would be really good, here is what would help, this would be of tremendous help.
1:26:12.160000 :  I can tell you that I've talked to some students about it, and they told me the very things that we're trying them to do.
1:26:21.160000 :  So it's something that we would take very seriously.
1:26:23.160000 :  Another thing that we will also probably do, and that we'll go through the ad hoc committee and other committees, is somewhat modify the curriculum.
1:26:33.160000 :  Add more courses either on issues relating to feminism.
1:26:39.160000 :  Add courses that focus on something that came up in the draft that you sent us, courses by female philosophers.
1:26:49.160000 :  There are so many of them, they are really outstanding.
1:26:54.160000 :  It would be great to have a course on Hannah Arendt. I think it would be of great interest.
1:27:00.160000 :  So that's another thing that we could do.
1:27:05.160000 :  But hearing from you, from the student body, would be very helpful.
1:27:09.160000 :  Because then we would together recognize the complexity of this situation, and work together on seeing what we can do.
1:27:17.160000 :  It's a problem that both of us have. Let's try to solve together.
1:27:24.160000 :  So we are trying to think, some colleagues are very active actually, Professor Keyes, one of them, when it comes to thinking of concrete ideas, what we can do.
1:27:37.160000 :  We will try to carry them through.
1:27:42.160000 :  What is the attitude towards gender issue of other department members?
1:27:49.160000 :  So this is something that we have started discussing this year, I would say, in the meetings.
1:27:56.160000 :  So at this point, where are our general discussions, the first big step that we want to take is, as I mentioned, higher female cox.
1:28:09.160000 :  So we are discussing the problems that reach us through the students, when it comes to students who do speak out.
1:28:18.160000 :  Of course by not pointing fingers at them, but pointing fingers at problems.
1:28:23.160000 :  So at this point, all of us realize that it is a problem.
1:28:33.160000 :  And there is a general consensus regarding the very fact that it is a problem, and what we can then possibly do to address it.
1:28:43.160000 :  And then different people voice different suggestions, different ideas.
1:28:46.160000 :  I think it is something that we will discuss, the way the meetings are structured at the department.
1:28:51.160000 :  The biggest meeting is in the summer, and the so-called retreat meeting.
1:28:56.160000 :  That is one of the top items on the agenda.
1:29:00.160000 :  That is what we want to do, because then we have more time.
1:29:04.160000 :  So that is what we want to address it in a much greater way.
1:29:08.160000 :  I would like to know why the department considers gender issues a problem.
1:29:13.160000 :  I want to know what are the reasons, because maybe we have different perspectives.
1:29:18.160000 :  One of the things is that we are an all-male department.
1:29:26.160000 :  It is really high time to become a department of the 21st century, in order to have some gender balance.
1:29:33.160000 :  We are really anachronistic, nobody can understand that we stand out in all possible regards.
1:29:38.160000 :  Not in a good way.
1:29:40.160000 :  So that is one thing.
1:29:41.160000 :  If we hear of students raising concerns, then students express surprise to us.
1:29:57.160000 :  Incoming students do surprise. Why?
1:30:00.160000 :  Aren't there any female colleagues?
1:30:02.160000 :  Once there is that contact, once there is something that we hear, we can turn and start addressing this issue.
1:30:08.160000 :  It makes it much easier for us.
1:30:11.160000 :  So, yes.
1:30:16.160000 :  Maybe just to complement some of what has just been said.
1:30:20.160000 :  When I spoke earlier, and again it is not just us, but almost every philosophy department has a higher attrition rate for female students than male students.
1:30:31.160000 :  More female students leaving between coming in and graduating.
1:30:36.160000 :  That is a concern for us, in part because we lose something in our philosophical community.
1:30:41.160000 :  I talked about that imaginary or real female student who after first or second year says, you know what, philosophy is not for me.
1:30:48.160000 :  Actually philosophy was for her, but she did not have the kind of role model or she did not have the kind of culture that helped her see that.
1:30:56.160000 :  So we lost that person from our philosophical community.
1:31:00.160000 :  We lost what she had to contribute to philosophy just because of sociological factors of the makeup of the department and historical factors.
1:31:09.160000 :  That are not really essential to what she wanted to do and what she had to contribute to philosophy.
1:31:15.160000 :  So to think that we are losing great students who maybe really do belong in philosophy because they do not see the kind of role models or they do not see the kind of culture here that makes them feel like they belong is a huge loss for us.
1:31:39.160000 :  Maybe we can proceed to this one.
1:31:49.160000 :  How much longer do you think the interview will last?
1:31:54.160000 :  There are other things I will need to attend to today web wise.
1:31:58.160000 :  It is okay we can still continue, but I would not be able to continue until four.
1:32:03.160000 :  Do you think we can finish in ten minutes or fifteen minutes?
1:32:07.160000 :  I think that is possible.
1:32:10.160000 :  You mentioned something about curriculum. Why do we teach feminism related courses?
1:32:19.160000 :  We should, right?
1:32:23.160000 :  One of the reasons is that no department can do everything. Let us begin with that.
1:32:30.160000 :  Any department that wants to stand out needs to have specific strengths.
1:32:35.160000 :  So if you do everything you end up doing nothing.
1:32:39.160000 :  So our strengths are three strengths. Chinese, Anglo-American, Continent. This is what we focus.
1:32:46.160000 :  The courses that we teach relate to the expertise of the faculty members.
1:32:52.160000 :  So it would be very good for us to hire new faculty members who would be able to offer such a course.
1:33:02.160000 :  It would be very good in light of the problems that you are bringing up.
1:33:08.160000 :  But like everywhere else, what departments teach depends on their strengths.
1:33:14.160000 :  We are remarkably diverse in a different regard.
1:33:20.160000 :  When it comes to a department that would have strengths in Chinese, Anglo-American, and Continent, it is so difficult to find out.
1:33:29.160000 :  When it comes to faculty members from so many different corners of the globe, it is also difficult to find out.
1:33:36.160000 :  So we are diverse in a different sense.
1:33:40.160000 :  But in this sense, we need to...
1:33:44.160000 :  This is something that is incredibly distinctive of our department.
1:33:48.160000 :  And I think it singles us out in world philosophy as something very special about us.
1:33:53.160000 :  That is not to say that teaching feminism is not important.
1:33:56.160000 :  We need to find a way to incorporate that into our curriculum.
1:34:00.160000 :  And we are working on that.
1:34:02.160000 :  But we don't want to lose what is distinctive and makes us unique in world philosophy about this department.
1:34:07.160000 :  So as you can see, there are just a lot of constraints that we have to work with when we adjust faculty and adjust curriculum.
1:34:15.160000 :  Maybe another thing to add with regard to this question as well as other comments.
1:34:20.160000 :  One of the interviews had a lot to say about Professor Colombetti's class.
1:34:24.160000 :  So we are in very close touch with Professor Colombetti, which is a department for conference theater that we co-organize together.
1:34:33.160000 :  We are looking into possibilities to establish a dual degree program with Exeter,
1:34:39.160000 :  which would enable students to spend a few years studying in Hong Kong, a few years in Exeter.
1:34:45.160000 :  It would enable them to graduate with both degrees.
1:34:48.160000 :  And one of the reasons for that is that both departments complement each other in very significant ways.
1:34:54.160000 :  So say courses on feminism would be something that they would definitely be able to take there.
1:35:00.160000 :  Because they have a number of colleagues who are qualified to do that.
1:35:05.160000 :  For courses in Chinese philosophy, also in a lot of continental philosophy, also in history philosophy, something that they don't do.
1:35:11.160000 :  So for students from both sides that would be very good.
1:35:14.160000 :  So that's another. So as you see, we are pursuing a number of steps.
1:35:17.160000 :  That is important, but not enough.
1:35:20.160000 :  What we need is a permanent colleague who will be able to do that.
1:35:24.160000 :  Thank you.
1:35:28.160000 :  So why does the department only provide a few courses that cover contemporary philosophy and new to disciplinary training in both of the courses?
1:35:40.160000 :  Again, the answer is the same as I mentioned earlier.
1:35:44.160000 :  That much has to do with faculty's expertise.
1:35:49.160000 :  But here is what happens every single year.
1:35:51.160000 :  Every single year we send out a questionnaire, the students asking them what courses they would like the department to offer.
1:36:00.160000 :  And the students fill out the forms and give us the answer.
1:36:05.160000 :  I can tell you that when it comes to those courses that most of the students want us to offer, this is a priority for us.
1:36:13.160000 :  And when it comes to course planning, we make sure that we offer these courses.
1:36:17.160000 :  So we do take the students' views into account.
1:36:21.160000 :  But otherwise, well again, it has to do with the expertise of the department, like anywhere else.
1:36:28.160000 :  No department can do everything.
1:36:30.160000 :  The department will do what its faculty is specializing in, or some more general courses.
1:36:38.160000 :  In general, at the university level, there is a push for more multidisciplinary courses.
1:36:44.160000 :  So I think the department will see more of these possibilities at the faculty level.
1:36:52.160000 :  Have you heard expressed an interest from students in more multidisciplinary courses specifically?
1:36:59.160000 :  I've heard from Gangnam.
1:37:03.160000 :  From our interviews, she spoke to us about the ideas that thought being taught in the current philosophy curriculum does not resonate with her a lot.
1:37:31.160000 :  Rather, some other philosophers, some people might not consider them philosophers, but she resonates with their thoughts more.
1:37:42.160000 :  And she wanted to have more exposure to those philosophical thoughts that maybe some philosophy students think are not as pure as, say, epistemology, metaphysics, and stuff like that.
1:38:09.160000 :  So just tapping into the multidisciplinary part, perhaps things that are more related to sociology, anthropology, things like that.
1:38:24.160000 :  So on some occasions, faculty members have co-taught courses for the other faculty members.
1:38:32.160000 :  I'm thinking especially of Professor Moss, who has co-taught a course from a colleague from the music department.
1:38:39.160000 :  So again, when there are interests, then you have these kinds of multidisciplinary courses offered usually at the faculty level.
1:38:47.160000 :  Because each department has its own curriculum, and we do want you to graduate with a solid understanding of philosophy.
1:38:56.160000 :  This is in fact our responsibility.
1:38:59.160000 :  We hope that you stand out when compared to many others because of the philosophical education, and that's what we want to pride you with.
1:39:08.160000 :  But at the university level, let us say there are different channels for courses at the borderline, as you mentioned, courses that some say are not, texts that are not written by philosophers.
1:39:25.160000 :  Anything you want to add?
1:39:28.160000 :  We will still ask these questions.
1:39:32.160000 :  Some have argued that philosophy in itself, or most of the philosophers, tend to deny the reliability of individual experience.
1:39:39.160000 :  Could you say that again?
1:39:42.160000 :  Some have argued that philosophy in itself, or most of the philosophers, tend to deny the reliability of individual experience. What do you think?
1:39:51.160000 :  That's a philosophical question.
1:39:56.160000 :  Experience is actually of great interest to me.
1:40:00.160000 :  You pose the question to two phenomenologists.
1:40:04.160000 :  You pose it to two others in the department, you might get a different answer.
1:40:08.160000 :  So for instance, it's a very important philosophical question. It falls usually under the heading of individuation.
1:40:18.160000 :  How does the process of individuation take place?
1:40:22.160000 :  How do we become who we are?
1:40:26.160000 :  Through what process? Clearly there must be objective factors, there must be also subjective factors.
1:40:33.160000 :  So to use a basic example, you know, you take, you know, okay, the three of you are in the same room right now.
1:40:41.160000 :  So you are in the same situation. You are asking questions that relate to the integrals and so forth.
1:40:47.160000 :  But subjectively, it's all very different.
1:40:49.160000 :  So to account for a situation, you need to take into account the individual nature of experience.
1:40:57.160000 :  Now what you will come in literature, for instance, are unbelievable descriptions of the individuality of experience.
1:41:04.160000 :  Also in psychology, also in cognitive science.
1:41:08.160000 :  In much of philosophy, what is at stake is, you know, or in phenomenology, the interest is to, you know, the question is,
1:41:14.160000 :  can we recognize and can we present the fundamental structures or the fundamental development through which the individual becomes who he or she is?
1:41:28.160000 :  So that's a very important philosophical question.
1:41:31.160000 :  And philosophy itself has particular methods to address it alongside all other disciplines.
1:41:37.160000 :  And that's where multidisciplinary becomes very interesting, right?
1:41:40.160000 :  Because then you can bring the two together.
1:41:43.160000 :  The reason why I asked that question, because one of our interviewees has said, because philosophers like to propose some universal claims to represent all humans.
1:41:58.160000 :  But actually each person's experience is different.
1:42:02.160000 :  But if philosophers don't look at individual's experience, then they will just generalize something.
1:42:11.160000 :  Yeah, very good, very good. So I hope the student is bringing up these issues in class.
1:42:16.160000 :  That's very important.
1:42:18.160000 :  And you mentioned three terms, universality, generality, individuality.
1:42:22.160000 :  So at what point philosophers say they want to establish universal claims?
1:42:27.160000 :  Now as soon as, say, the student or anybody else succeeds at demonstrating that there is an exception that clearly brings up the question there, universal pretension,
1:42:37.160000 :  it has to be rethought.
1:42:41.160000 :  Now these count examples can come either from our experiences or also from fiction.
1:42:50.160000 :  Here imagination also can play a very important role.
1:42:53.160000 :  So I hope the student is bringing those questions up, because this is of crucial importance for philosophy.
1:42:58.160000 :  It's only by raising questions of individuality that philosophy can make a serious claim to universality.
1:43:04.160000 :  And if it figures out that various individual experiences force us to rethink the universal claims,
1:43:12.160000 :  then you end up with various conceptions of universality, say the concrete universe,
1:43:18.160000 :  where a universe often changes over time by taking the individuality into account.
1:43:23.160000 :  So it's very, to my mind, fascinating and interesting and important, philosophy.
1:43:28.160000 :  Something that philosophy does take into account and has to and definitely has to.
1:43:35.160000 :  Anything you want to add?
1:43:38.160000 :  I have nothing more to add.
1:43:41.160000 :  Okay.
1:43:43.160000 :  So I guess...
1:43:45.160000 :  Okay, so very good.
1:43:47.160000 :  Yeah.
1:43:50.160000 :  Like I said, you guys are collaborators in this.
1:43:53.160000 :  You're aware of an issue that we are also aware of, and we have different perspectives on it,
1:43:58.160000 :  and I hope that we can work together, share information and resources to make genuine headway on a problem,
1:44:05.160000 :  rather than just report on it and talk about it.
1:44:08.160000 :  Ultimately, we hope that some change will issue from the investigations.
1:44:13.160000 :  So keep in contact.
1:44:16.160000 :  My door is always open, and I hope we'll see each other again.
1:44:19.160000 :  Keep in contact.
1:44:21.160000 :  My door is always open, and I hope we can work so that some genuine change and improvement will come about from this.
1:44:29.160000 :  I can only agree with that.
1:44:31.160000 :  Let's work on this together.
1:44:33.160000 :  It's even good to hear a number of your questions.
1:44:35.160000 :  It's good for us because about some issues we had no idea before.
1:44:40.160000 :  So in many regards, it's through you that we will find out about the problem.
1:44:44.160000 :  And not only that, I don't want to limit it to this, but I would very much like all of us, the students and the students,
1:44:53.160000 :  to work together on possible solutions.
1:44:55.160000 :  Let's consider various options and see what that leads us to.
1:45:01.160000 :  Yeah, you can definitely pass that information on.
1:45:04.160000 :  Please. Thank you.
1:45:06.160000 :  So stay tuned as things are developing on our side.
1:45:09.160000 :  We've got a couple of initiatives that we'll be pushing in this direction.
1:45:11.160000 :  That's very much just in the works right now, but we'll keep you guys up to speed.
1:45:17.160000 :  Please consider being part of the Reformed Philosophy Society as that takes on a new shape.
1:45:23.160000 :  And again, beyond just reporting on what's going on in the culture, that's a place where you guys can genuinely play a role in forming a new culture.
1:45:32.160000 :  You certainly can.
1:45:34.160000 :  So please consider being part of that.
1:45:36.160000 :  Okay.
1:45:38.160000 :  Okay.
1:45:40.160000 :  Do you like to be part of the study?
1:45:45.160000 :  We will write an article based on this interview.
1:45:49.160000 :  How do you want us to address you?
1:45:53.160000 :  How do you want us to call you?
1:45:56.160000 :  You can call me any way you want to call me.
1:45:59.160000 :  All is fine.
1:46:00.160000 :  Is it okay to use your real name?
1:46:04.160000 :  Yeah.
1:46:06.160000 :  Is it fine for us to call you Sally?
1:46:10.160000 :  You can call me Saulus.
1:46:12.160000 :  Yes, you can call me Saulus.
1:46:16.160000 :  It would be good if you also floated a draft of the interview ahead of time.
1:46:21.160000 :  It would be good if you also floated a draft of the interview ahead of time.
1:46:31.160000 :  So if you shared a draft of the interview with us.
1:46:38.160000 :  Because they know I say no, no, no, actually I was trying to say something different.
1:46:43.160000 :  Do you want the transcript of the interview or the draft?
1:46:48.160000 :  That would be helpful, I think. At the end of the day the interview will be better.
1:46:51.160000 :  Do you have a plan to publish?
1:46:53.160000 :  Of course we don't want to censor you or anything.
1:46:56.160000 :  But consider that I think we've been very generous in our time and speaking just very freely with you guys.
1:47:02.160000 :  And we would hope in exchange for that that you would give a fair representation of what you've said.
1:47:08.160000 :  And also that if there was anything that upon seeing it in print we said like,
1:47:13.160000 :  oh that's really not what we were trying to say or that feels like it misrepresents us a little bit.
1:47:17.160000 :  We would hope that as part of journalistic responsibility you would not want to misrepresent us.
1:47:24.160000 :  Of course.
1:47:26.160000 :  Also we find out it's like, oh I said something that is confidential, right?
1:47:30.160000 :  I shouldn't be saying that. I don't think that has happened.
1:47:33.160000 :  But if that happens, right, to avoid these kind of things.
1:47:36.160000 :  In the spirit of collaboration we've been very open and spoken very frankly with you guys.
1:47:41.160000 :  It would be generous if in return you would let us have a look at what you've said.
1:47:45.160000 :  We would appreciate that.
1:47:47.160000 :  We would appreciate that.
1:47:49.160000 :  We will send you the draft of our article and to get your consent and advice.
1:47:54.160000 :  Okay.
1:47:56.160000 :  Okay. Okay. Let's finish here.
